# Circular Queue
  
This program performs basic Enqueue and Dequeue Queue Operations on a Priority Queue.  
It can create a queue sorted in Ascending as well as Descending order.  
It can also retrieve Max and Min elements from the Queue.  
Utilizes the switch statements to access the multiple functions for different operations.
