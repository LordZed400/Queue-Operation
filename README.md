# Queue Operations

Queue operations include Enqueue and Dequeue, where data is inserted into the Queue or Removed from the Queue respectively.  
Queues can be of different types, namely  
- Linear Queue  
It has multiple nodes to store data, where one node is linked to its next and previous node and can be traversed.  
- Circular Queue  
Similar to a Linear queue, but the last node of the queue points to the first node of the queue.  
- Priority Queue  
Priority Queue is a Linear Queue, but the data or the elements are sorted according to priority.
